# Crowd Counting and Density Estimation using CNN (TensorFlow)

This project demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for estimating crowd density and counting people in an image. It uses a simulated dataset by generating artificial density maps over a single uploaded image.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload any image and simulate a crowd density map.
- Build and train a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Predict a density map and estimate crowd count.
- Visualize both the original image and predicted density map.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless scipy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
